# Timeline

### Level 3

Timeline is a simple photo sharing service. Students will bring in many concepts that they have learned, and add more complex data modeling, Image Picker, CloudKit, and protocol-oriented programming to make a Capstone Level project spanning multiple days and concepts.

Most concepts will be covered during class, others are introduced during the project. Not every instruction will outline each line of code to write, but lead the student to the solution. 

Students who complete this project independently are able to:

#### Part One - Project Planning, Model Objects, and Controllers

* follow a project planning framework to build a development plan
* follow a project planning framework to prioritize and manage project progress
* implement relationships in a Core Data model architecture
* use staged data to prototype features

#### Part Two - Apple View Controllers, Search Controller, Container Views

* implement search using the system search controller
* use the image picker controller and activity controller
* use container views to abstract shared functionality into a single view controller

#### Part Three - Basic CloudKit: CloudKitManager, CloudKitManagedObject, Manual Sync

* check CloudKit availability
* save data to CloudKit
* fetch data from CloudKit
* query data from CloudKit
* sync pulled CloudKit data to a local Core Data persistent store

#### Part Four - Intermediate CloudKit: Subscriptions, Push Notifications, Automatic Sync

* use subscriptions to generate push notifications
* use push notifications to run a push based sync engine


## Part One - Project Planning, Model Objects, and Controllers

* follow a project planning framework to build a development plan
* follow a project planning framework to prioritize and manage project progress
* implement relationships in a Core Data model architecture
* use staged data to prototype features

Follow the development plan included with the project to build out the basic view hierarchy, basic implementation of local model objects, model object controllers, and helper classes. Build staged data to lay a strong foundation for the rest of the app.

### View Hierarchy

Implement the view hierarchy in Storyboards. The app will have a Timeline tableview that will also use a Search Controller to display search results. Both the Timeline view and the Search Results view will display a list of `Post` objects and segue to a `Post` detail view.

The Navigation Controller should have a Plus (+) button that presents a modal Add Post scene that will allow the user to select a photo, add a caption, and submit the photo.

1. Add a `UITableViewController` Timeline scene, embed it in a `UINavigationController`, add a Plus (+) button as the right bar button. 
2. Add a `PostListTableViewController` subclass of `UITableViewController` and assign it to the Timeline scene
3. Add a `UITableViewController` Post Detail scene, add a segue to it from the Timeline scene
4. Add a `PostDetailTableViewController` subclass of `UITableViewController` and assign it to the Post Detail scene
5. Add a `UITableViewController` Add Post scene, embed it into a `UINavigationController`, and add a modal presentation segue to it from the Plus (+) button on the Timeline scene
    * note: Because this scene will use a modal presentation, it will not inherit the `UINavigationBar` from the Timeline scene
6. Add a `AddPostTableViewController` subclass of `UITableViewcontroller` and assign it to the Add Post scene.
7. Add a `UITableViewcontroller` Search Results scene. It does not need a relationship to any other view controller.
    * note: You will implement this scene in Part 2 when setting up the `UISearchController` on the Search scene
8. Add a `SearchResultsTableViewController` subclass of `UITableViewController` and assign it to the Search Results scene.

### Implement Model

Timeline will use a Core Data local persistent storage with a basic CloudKit based sync engine. To begin, add Core Data to the project by creating a Core Data Model xcdatamodel file, and adding the `Stack` file that will be used to access Core Data. Then use the Core Data Model file to create your local Core Data model objects.

You will want to save `Post` objects that hold the image data, and `Comment` objects that hold text. A `Post` should own a set of `Comment` objects.

While you will not implement sync in this portion of the project, it is important to recognize the need for syncing when designing your model.

#### SyncableObject

Create a `SyncableObject` model object that will hold shared data for both `Post` and `Comment` objects. `Post` and `Comment` objects will need to share a set of properties that make it easier for syncing in a future step. The shared properties will include a timestamp, a unique identifier, and additional data that will help determine if the object has been synced to the server.

1. Add a new `SyncableObject` Core Data entity to your managed object model. Add a `timestamp` Date attribute, a `recordName` String attribute, and a `recordIDData` NSData attribute. Set the `recordName` and `timestamp` attributes as required.
2. Select the `recordName` and `timestamp` attributes and deselect the 'Optional' option in the Attribute Inspector panel.

#### Post

Create a `Post` model object that will hold image data. Most often, Core Data is backed by a SQLite persistent store. SQLite databases are not built for managing large data blobs like photos. Use the 'Allows external storage' option to have Core Data manage storing the data to disk instead of the database itself. Core Data will automatically store the data to disk and include a reference to that data in the database instead.

1. Add a new `Post` Core Data entity to your managed object model. Add a `photoData` Binary Data attribute. 
2. Set the `SyncableObject` as the Parent Entity. 
    * note: This will make the `Post` entity a subclass of the `SyncableObject` class, inheriting all of it's properties.
3. Select the `photoData` attribute and choose the 'Allows External Storage' option in the Attribute Inspector panel.
4. Create the `NSManagedObject` subclass files.
5. Add a convenience initializer that accepts a `photo` parameter as `NSData`, and a timestamp parameter as an `NSDate`.
6. Implement the convenience initializer, calling the `init(entity: insertIntoManagedObjectContext:)` function that normally is called by the `NSEntityDescription.entityForName(name:, inManagedObjectContext:)` function.

#### Comment

Create a `Comment` model object that will hold user-submitted text comments for a specific `Post`. 

1. Add a new `Comment` Core Data entity to your managed object model. Add a `text` String attribute.
2. Set the `SyncableObject` as the Parent Entity. 
    * note: This will make the `Comment` entity a subclass of the `SyncableObject` class, inheriting all of it's properties.
3. Add a relationship that supports adding multiple `Comment` object relationships to a single `Post` object, set the inverse relationship on the `Post` object.
4. Create the `NSManagedObject` subclass files.
5. Add a convenience initializer that accepts a `Post` parameter, a text parameter, and a timestamp parameter as an `NSDate`.
    * note: Include the `Post` parameter because a `Comment` cannot exist without a parent `Post`. This is a common pattern for doing [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). 
6. Implement the convenience initializer, calling the `init(entity: insertIntoManagedObjectContext:)` function that normally is called by the `NSEntityDescription.entityForName(name:, inManagedObjectContext:) function.


### Model Object Controller

Add and implement the `PostController` class that will be used for CRUD operations. 

1. Add a new `PostController` class file.
2. Add a `sharedController` singleton property.
3. Add a `saveContext` function that saves the `Stack`'s `managedObjectContext`.
4. Add a `createPost` function that takes an image parameter as a `UIImage` and a caption as a `String`.
5. Implement the `createPost` function to initialize a `Post` with the image and a `Comment` with the caption text and save the context.
6. Add a `addCommentToPost` function that takes a `text` parameter as a `String`, and a `Post` parameter.
7. Implement the `addCommentToPost` function to call the appropriate `Comment` initializer and save the context.


### Wire Up Views

#### Timeline Scene - Post List Table View Controller

Implement the Post List Table View Controller. You will use a similar cell to display posts in multiple scenes in your application. Create a custom `PostTableViewCell` that can be reused in different scenes.

1. Implement the scene in Interface Builder by creating a custom cell with an image view that fills the cell. 
2. Create a `PostTableViewCell` class, add and implement an `updateWithPost` to the `PostTableViewCell` to update the image view with the `Post`'s photo.
3. Choose a height that will be used for your image cells. To avoid worrying about resizing images or dynamic cell heights, you may want to use a consistent height for all of the image views in the app.
4. Overwrite the `viewDidLoad()` function to initialize an `NSFetchedResultsController` that pulls `Post` objects ordered by the `timestamp` property in reverse chronological order (latest post on top).
5. Implement the `UITableViewDataSource` functions using the `NSFetchedResultsController`.
    * note: The final app does not need to support any editing styles, but you may want to include support for editing while developing early stages of the app.
6. Implement the `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` functions to begin and end table view updates.
7. Implement the `prepareForSegue` function to check the segue identifier, capture the detail view controller, index path, selected post, and assign the selected post to the detail view controller.
    * note: You may need to quickly add a `post` property to the `PostDetailTableViewController`.

#### Post Detail Scene

Implement the Post Detail View Controller. This scene will be used for viewing post images and comments. Users will also have the option to add a comment, share the image, or follow the user that created the post.

Use the table view's header view to display the photo and a toolbar that allows the user to comment, share, or follow. Use the table view cells to display comments.

1. Add a vertical `UIStackView` to the Header of the table view. Add a `UIImageView` and a `UIToolbar` to the stack view. Add 'Comment', 'Share', and 'Follow Post' `UIBarButtonItem`s to the toolbar. Set up your constraints so that the image view is the height you chose previously for displaying images within your app.
2. Update the cell to support comments that span multiple lines without truncating them. Set the `UITableViewCell` to the subtitle style. Set the number of lines to zero. Implement dynamic heights by setting the `tableView.rowHeight` and `tableView.estimatedRowHeight` in the `viewDidLoad`.
3. Add an `updateWithPost` function that will update the scene with the details of the post. Implement the function by setting the `imageView.image` and reloading the table view if needed.
4. Overwrite the `viewDidLoad()` function to initialize an `NSFetchedResultsController` that pulls `Comment` objects matching the `self.post` property, ordered by the `timestamp` property in chronological order (latest comment on bottom).
    * note: You will need to set a predicate on the `NSFetchRequest` (hint: `"post == $@"`)
5. Implement the `UITableViewDataSource` functions using the `NSFetchedResultsController`.
    * note: The final app does not need to support any editing styles, but you may want to include support for editing while developing early stages of the app.
5. Add an IBAction for the 'Comment' button. Implement the IBAction by presenting a `UIAlertController` with a text field, a Cancel action, and an 'OK' action. Implement the 'OK' action to initialize a new `Comment` via the `PostController` and reload the table view to display it.
    * note: Do not create a new `Comment` if the user has not added text.
6. Add an IBAction for the 'Share' and 'Follow' buttons. You will implement these two actions in future steps.

#### Add Post Scene

Implement the Add Post Table View Controller. You will use a static table view to create a simple form for adding a new post. Use three sections for the form:

Section 1: Large button to select an image, and a `UIImageView` to display the selected image
Section 2: Caption text field
Section 3: Add Post button

Until you implement the `UIImagePickerController`, you will use a staged static image to add new posts.

1. Assign the table view to use static cells. Adopt the 'Grouped' cell style. Add three sections.
2. Build the first section by creating a tall image selection/preview cell. Add a 'Select Image' `UIButton` that fills the cell. Add an empty `UIImageView` that also fills the cell. Make sure that the button is on top of the image view so it can properly recognize tap events.
3. Build the second section by adding a `UITextField` that fills the cell. Assign placeholder text so the user recognizes what the text field is for.
4. Build the third section by adding a 'Add Post' `UIButton` that fills the cell. 
5. Add an IBAction to the 'Select Image' `UIButton` that assigns a static image to the image view (add a sample image to the Assets.xcassets that you can use for prototyping this feature), and removes the title text from the button.
    * note: It is important to remove the title text so that the user no longer sees that a button is there, but do not remove the entire button, that way the user can tap again to select a different image.
6. Add an IBAction to the 'Add Post' `UIButton` that checks for an `image` and `caption`. If there is an `image` and a `caption`, use the `PostController` to create a new `Post` and dismiss the view controller. If either the image or a caption is missing, present an alert directing the user to check their information and try again.
7. Add a 'Cancel' `UIBarButtonItem` as the left bar button item. Implement the IBAction to dismiss the view.

#### A Note on Reusable Code

Consider that this Photo Selection functionality could be useful in different views and in different applications. New developers will be tempted to copy and paste the functionality wherever it is needed. That amount of repetition should give you pause. _Don't repeat yourself_ (DRY) is a shared value among skilled software developers.

Avoiding repetition is an important way to become a better developer and maintain sanity when building larger applications.

Imagine a scenario where you have three classes with similar functionality. Each time you fix a bug or add a feature to any of those classes, you must go and repeat that in all three places. This commonly leads to differences, which leads to bugs.

You will refactor the Photo Selection functionality (selecting and assigning an image) into a reusable child view controller in Part 2. 

### Polish Rough Edges

At this point you should be able view added post images in the Timeline Post List scene, add new `Post` objects from the Add Post Scene, add new `Comment` objects from the Post Detail Scene, and persist and use user profile information provided by the current user. 

Use the app and polish any rough edges. Check table view cell selection. Check text fields. Check proper view hierarchy and navigation models.

### Black Diamonds

* Review the README instructions and solution code for clarity and functionality, submit a GitHub pull request with suggested changes.
* Provide feedback on the expectations for Part One to a mentor or instructor.

## Part Two - Search Controller, Container Views, Apple View Controllers

* implement search using the system search controller
* use the image picker controller and activity controller
* use container views to abstract shared functionality into a single view controller

Add and implement search functionality to the search view. Implement the Image Picker Controller on the Add Post scene. Decrease the amount of repeated code by refactoring the similar functionality in the Add Post scenes into a child view controller that is used in both classes.

### Search Controller

Build functionality that will allow the user to search for posts with comments that have specific text in them. For example, if a user creates a `Post` with a photo of a waterfall, and there are comments that mention the waterfall, the user should be able to search the Timeline view for the term 'water' and filter down to that post (and any others with water in the comments).

#### Update the Model

Add a `SearchableRecord` protocol that requires a `matchesSearchTerm` function. Update the `Post` and `Comment` objects to conform to the protocol.

1. Add a new `SearchableRecord.swift` file.
2. Define a `SearchableRecord` protocol with a required `matchesSearchTerm` function that takes a `searchTerm` parameter as a `String` and returns a `Bool`.
    * note: Because this protocol will be used on `NSManagedObject`s, add the `@objc` keyword to the protocol.

Consider how each model object will match to a specific search term. What searchable text is there on a `Comment`? What searchable text is there on a `Post`?

3. Update the `Comment` class to conform to the `SearchableRecord` protocol. Return `true` if `text` contains the search term, otherwise return `false`.
4. Update the `Post` class to conform to the `SearchableRecord` protocol. Return `true` if any of the `Post` `comments` match, otherwise return `false`.

Use a Playground to test your `SearchableRecord` and `matchesSearchTerm` functionality and understand what you are implementing.

#### Search Results Controller

Search controllers typically have two views: a list view, and a search result view that displays the filtered results. The list view holds the search bar. When the user begins typing in the search bar, the `UISSearchController` presents a search results view. Your list view must conform to the `SearchResultsUpdating` protocol function, which implements updates to the results view.

Understanding Search Controllers requires you to understand that the main view controller can (and must) implement methods that handle what is being displayed on another view controller. The results controller must also implement a way to communicate back to the main list view controller to notify it of events. This is a two way relationship with communication happening in both directions.

1. Create a `SearchResultsTableViewController` subclass of `UITableViewController` and assign it to the scene in Interface Builder.
2. Add a `resultsArray` property that contains a list of `SearchableRecords`
3. Implement the `UITableViewDatasource` functions to display the search results.   
    * note: For now you will only display `Post` objects as a result of a search. Use the `PostTableViewCell` to do so.

#### Update Timeline Scene

1. Add a function `setUpSearchController` that captures the `resultsController` from the Storyboard, instantiates the `UISearchController`, sets the `searchResultsUpdater` to self, and adds the `searchController`'s `searchBar` as the table's header view.
2. Implement the `UISearchResultsUpdating` protocol `updateSearchResultsforSearchController` function. The function should capture the `resultsViewController` and the search text from the `searchController`'s `searchBar`, filter the local `posts` array for posts that match, assign the filtered results to the `resultsViewController`'s `resultsArray`, and reload the `resultsViewController`'s `tableView`.
    * note: Consider the communication that is happening here between two separate view controllers. Be sure that you understand this relationship.

##### Segue to Post Detail View

Remember that even though the Timeline view and the Search Results view are displaying similar cells and model objects, you are working with separate view controllers with separate cells and instances of table views. 

The segue from a `Post` should take the user to the Post Detail scene, regardless of whether that is from the Timeline view or the Search Results view.

To do so, implement the `UITableViewDelegate` `didSelectRow` function on the Search Results scene to manually call the `toPostDetail` segue _from the Search scene_.

1. Adopt the `UITableViewDelegate` on the Search Results scene and add the `didSelectRowAtIndexPath` function. Implement the function by capturing the sending cell and telling the Search Result scene's `presentingViewController` to `performSegueWithIdentifier` and send the selected cell so that the Search scene can get the selected `Post`.
    * note: Every view controller class has an optional `presentingViewController` reference to the view controller that presented it. In this case, the presenting view controller of the Search Results scene is the Timeline scene. So this step will manually call the `performSegueWithIdentifier` on the Search scene.
2. Update the `prepareForSegue` function on the Search Scene to capture and segue to the Post Detail scene with the correct post. Try to do so without looking at the solution code.
    * note: You must check if the `tableView` can get an `indexPath` for the sender. If it can, that means that the cell was from the Search scene's `tableView`. If it can't, that means the cell is from the Search Result scene's `tableView` and that the user tapped a search result. If that is the case, capture the `Post` from the `resultsArray` on the `searchResultscontroller`.
    * note: You can access the `searchResultsController` by calling `(searchController.searchResultsController as? SearchResultsTableViewController)`

Try to work through the Search segue without looking at the solution code. Understanding this pattern will solidify your understanding of many object-oriented programming patterns.


### Image Picker Controller

#### Photo Select Child Scene

Implement the Image Picker Controller in place of the prototype functionality you built previously.

1. Update the 'Select Image' IBAction to present a `UIImagePickerController`. Give the user the option to select from their Photo Library or from the device's camera if their device has one. 
2. Implement the `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate` function to capture the selected image and assign it to the image view.

### Reduce Code Repetition

Refactor the photo selection functionality from the Add Post scene into a child view controller. 

Child view controllers control views that are a subview of another view controller. It is a great way to encapsulate functionality into one class that can be reused in multiple places. This is a great tool for any time you want a similar view to be present in multiple places.

In this instance, you will put 'Select Photo' button, the image view, and the code that presents and handles the `UIImagePickerController` into a `PhotoSelectorViewController` class. You will also define a protocol for the `PhotoSelectorViewController` class to communicate with it's parent view controller.

#### Container View and Embed Segues

Use a container view to embed a child view controller into the Add Post scene.

>Container View defines a region within a view controller's view subgraph that can include a child view controller. Create an embed segue from the container view to the child view controller in the storyboard.

1. Open `Main.storyboard` to your Add Post scene.
2. Add a new section to the static table view to build the Container View to embed the child view controller.
3. Search for Container View in the Object Library and add it to the newly created table view cell.
    * note: The Container View object will come with a view controller scene. You can use the included scene, or replace it with another scene. For now, use the included scene.
4. Set up contraints so that the Container View fills the entire cell.
5. Move or copy the Image View and 'Select Photo' button to the container view controller.
6. Create a new `PhotoSelectViewController` file as a subclass of `UIViewController` and assign the class to the scene in Interface Builder.
7. Create the necessary IBOutlets and IBActions, and migrate your Photo Picker code from the Add Post view controller class. Delete the old code from the Add Post view controller class.
8. Repeat the above steps for the Add Post scene. Instead of keeping the included child view controller from the Container View object, delete it, and add an 'Embed' segue from the container view to the scene you set up for the Add Post scene.

You now have two views that reference the same scene as a child view controller. This scene and accompanying class can now be used in both places, eliminating the need for code duplication.

#### Child View Controller Delegate

Your child view controller needs a way to communicate events to it's parent view controller. This is most commonly done through delegation. Define a child view controller delegate, adopt it in the parent view controller, and set up the relationship via the embed segue.

1. Define a new `PhotoSelectViewControllerDelegate` protocol in the `PhotoSelectViewController` file with a required `photoSelectViewControllerSelectedImage` function that takes a `UIImage` parameter to pass the image that was selected.
    * note: This function will tell the assigned delegate (the parent view controller, in this example) what image the user selected.
2. Add a weak optional delegate property.
3. Call the delegate function in the `didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo` function, passing the selected media to the delegate.
4. Adopt the `PhotoSelectViewControllerDelegate` protocol in the Add Post class file, implement the `photoSelectViewControllerSelectedImage` function to capture a reference to the selected image.
    * note: In the Add Post scene, you will use that captured reference to create a new post.

Note the use of the delegate pattern. You have encapsulated the Photo Selection workflow in one class, but by implementing the delegate pattern,  each parent view controller can implement it's own response to when a photo was selected. 

You have declared a protocol, adopted the protocol, but you now must assign the delegate property on the instance of the child view controller so that the `PhotoSelectViewController` can communicate with it's parent view controller. This is done by using the embed segue, which is called when the Container View is initialized from the Storyboard, which occurs when the view loads.

1. Assign segue identifiers to the embed segues in the Storyboard file
2. Update the `prepareForSegue` function in the Add Post scene to check for the segue identifier, capture the `destinationViewController` as a `PhotoSelectViewController`, and assign `self` as the child view controller's delegate.

### Post Detail View Controller Share Sheet

Use the `UIActivityController` class to present a share sheet from the Post Detail view. Share the image and the text of the first comment.

1. Add an IBAction from the Share button in your `PostDetailTableViewController`.
2. Initialize a `UIActivityController` with the `Post`'s image and the text of the first comment as the shareable objects.
3. Present the `UIActivityController`.

### Black Diamonds:

* Some apps will save photos taken or processed in their app in a custom Album in the user's Camera Roll. Add this feature.
* Review the README instructions and solution code for clarity and functionality, submit a GitHub pull request with suggested changes.
* Provide feedback on the expectations for Part One to a mentor or instructor.


## Part Three - Basic CloudKit: CloudKitManager, CloudKitManagedObject, Manual Sync

* check CloudKit availability
* save data to CloudKit
* fetch data from CloudKit
* sync pulled CloudKit data to a local Core Data persistent store

Following some of the best practices in the CloudKit documentation, add CloudKit to your project as a backend syncing engine for posts and comments. Check for CloudKit availability, save new posts and comments to CloudKit, fetch posts and comments from CloudKit and save them to Core Data.

When you finish this part, the app will support syncing photos, posts, and comments from the device to CloudKit, and pulling new photos, posts, and comments from CloudKit. When new posts or comments are fetched from CloudKit, they will be serialized into Core Data objects, and the Fetched Results Controllers will automatically update the user interface with the new data.

You will implement push notifications, subscriptions, and basic automatic sync functionality in Part Four.

### CloudKit Manager

Add a CloudKit Manager that abstracts your CloudKit code into a single helper class that implements basic CloudKit functionality. You will not necessarily use all of the `CloudKitManager` functionality in this application, but this will be a great reusable class for future CloudKit applications that you build in the future.

1. Add a `CloudKitManager` helper class.
2. Add the following properties and function signatures that perform basic CloudKit functionality. 

```swift

    let publicDatabase: CKDatabase
    let privateDatabase: CKDatabase

    init()
    // check CloudKit availability


    // MARK: - User Info Discovery

    func fetchLoggedInUserRecord(completion: ((record: CKRecord?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func fetchUsernameFromRecordID(recordID: CKRecordID, completion: ((givenName: String?, familyName: String?) -> Void)?)

    func fetchAllDiscoverableUsers(completion: ((userInfoRecords: [CKDiscoveredUserInfo]?) -> Void)?)


    // MARK: - Fetch Records

    func fetchRecordWithID(recordID: CKRecordID, completion: ((record: CKRecord?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func fetchRecordsWithType(type: String, predicate: NSPredicate = default, recordFetchedBlock: ((record: CKRecord) -> Void)?, completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func fetchCurrentUserRecords(type: String, completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func fetchRecordsFromDateRange(type: String, recordType: String, fromDate: NSDate, toDate: NSDate, completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)


    // MARK: - Delete Records

    func deleteRecordWithID(recordID: CKRecordID, completion: ((recordID: CKRecordID?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func deleteRecordsWithID(recordIDs: [CKRecordID], completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, recordIDs: [CKRecordID]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)


    // MARK: - Save Records

    func saveRecords(records: [CKRecord], perRecordCompletion: ((record: CKRecord?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?, completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func saveRecord(record: CKRecord, completion: ((record: CKRecord?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)

    func modifyRecords(records: [CKRecord], perRecordCompletion: ((record: CKRecord?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?, completion: ((records: [CKRecord]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)


    // MARK: - CloudKit Availability

    func checkCloudKitAvailability()

    func handleCloudKitUnavailable(accountStatus: CKAccountStatus, error: NSError?)

    func displayCloudKitNotAvailableError(errorText: String)


    // MARK: - CloudKit User Discoverability

    func requestDiscoverabilityPermission()

    func handleCloudKitPermissionStatus(permissionStatus: CKApplicationPermissionStatus, error: NSError?)

    func displayCloudKitPermissionsNotGrantedError(errorText: String)
```

3. Using the documentation for CloudKit, fulfill the contract of each function signature. Using the data passed in as a paremeter, write code that will return the requested information. When it makes sense to do so using the NSOperation subclasses, try to use them over the convenience functions.

### CloudKitManagedObject

Write a protocol that will define how the app will work with CloudKit and Core Data objects. Add a protocol extension that adds predefined convenience functionality to each object that adopts that protocol.

The `CloudKitManagedObject` protocol will define the required properties and functions that our `Post` and `Comment` objects will need. 

The protocol extension will add some shared functionality that our `Post` and `Comment` objects will need.

#### Protocol

```swift
    
    timestamp: NSDate // date and time the object was created
    recordIDData: NSData? // persisted CKRecordID
    recordName: String // unique name for the object
    recordType: String // a consistent type string, 'Post' for Post, 'Comment' for Comment

    var cloudKitRecord: CKRecord? // a generated record representation of the `NSManagedObject` that can be saved to CloudKit (similar to `dictionaryValue` when working with REST APIs)

    init?(record: CKRecord, context: NSManagedObjectContext) // to initialize a new `NSManagedObject` from a `CKRecord` from CloudKit (similar to `init?(json: [String: AnyObject])` when working with REST APIs)
```

The `CloudKitManagedObject` types will need to have a timestamp, a way to persist the data from a `CKRecordID` object into the persistent store, a unique record name, a record type that will be used to separate `CKRecord` types on CloudKit, and a way to represent the managed object as a `CKRecord` for when we want to push the data to CloudKit.

Note that the timestamp, recordName, and recordIDData properties will already exist on the `Post` and `Comment` types because they are subclassed from the `SyncableObject` type defined in the Core Data model.

1. Create a new `CloudKitManagedObject` file that defines a new protocol named `CloudKitManagedObject`.
2. Add required gettable and settable variables for the `timestamp` as an `NSDate`, `recordIDData` as optional `NSData`, and `recordName` as a `String`.
    * `CKRecordID` conforms to the `NSCoding` protocol, which allows it to be easily serialized to and from `NSData`. Core Data does not natively support saving `CKRecordID` objects, but we can set the `NSData` of a `CKRecordID` to the `recordIDData` by using `NSKeyedArchiver`.
3. Add required gettable computed properties for the `recordType` as a String, and `cloudKitRecord` as an optional CKRecord.
4. Add a required `updateWithRecord` function that accepts a `CKRecord` as a parameter. This function will be used to update the Core Data object with the `CKRecord` data received from CloudKit.

#### Protocol Extension

```swift

    var isSynced: Bool // helper variable to determine if a CloudKitManagedObject has a CKRecordID, which we can use to say that the record has been saved to the server
    var cloudKitRecordID: CKRecordID? // a computed property that unwraps the persisted recordIDData into a CKRecordID, or returns nil if there isn't one
    var cloudKitReference: CKReference? // a computed property that returns a CKReference to the object in CloudKit

    func update(record: CKRecord) // called after saving the object, saved the record.recordID to the recordIDData
```

5. Add a protocol extension for the `CloudKitManagedObject`
6. Add a computed property `isSynced: Bool` that returns true if `recordIDData` is not nil
    * note: When a record is synced to CloudKit, CloudKit returns a `CKRecord` object. You will pass that `CKRecord` object into the `update(record: CKRecord)` function, which will save the `record.recordID` as NSData to the `recordIDData` variable. So if that `recordIDData` variable _has_ data, then the object _has_ been synced. If not, it hasn't.
7. Add a computed property `cloudKitRecordID: CKRecordID?` that guards for the `recordIDData`, unwraps it as a `CKRecordID`, and returns it. Otherwise, return nil.
    * note: This is simply a helper function that returns our persisted `NSData?` version of the `CKRecordID` as an actual `CKRecordID`
    * note: Use `NSKeyedUnarchiver` to decode the `NSData`
8. Add a computed property `cloudKitReference: CKReference?` that guards for the `cloudKitRecordID` and returns a `CKReference` initialized with the `CKRecordID`. Otherwise, return nil.
    * note: In a future step, this will be used to help us pass a list of all synced objects to CloudKit so that we can request any new objects.
9. Add a update function that takes a `CKRecord` as a parameter. Implement the function to use `NSKeyedArchiver` to archive the `record.recordID` as NSData, set the `recordIDData` property, and save the managed object context.
10. Add a `nameForManagedObject` that returns a unique `String` identifier.
    * note: Use the `NSUUID` class to generate a unique identifier.

### Post Controller Manual Sync

Adopt the `CloudKitManagedObject` protocol in the `Post` and `Comment` classes. Update the `PostController` to use push `Post` and `Comment` objects to CloudKit and pull new `Post` or `Comment` objects from CloudKit.

#### Update Post for Sync Functionality

Adopt the `CloudKitManagedObject` protocol in the `Post` class.

1. Add a computed property `recordType` and return the type you would like used to identify 'Post' objects in CloudKit.
2. Add a computed property `cloudKitRecord` that returns an optional `CKRecord?` representation of the `Post`. Include the `timestamp` and a `CKAsset` that points to a URL of the photo data.
    * note: `CKAsset` is initialized with a URL. When creating a `CKAsset` on the local device, you initialize it with a URL to a local file path where the photo is located on disk. When you save a `CKAsset`, the data at that file path is uploaded to CloudKit. When you pull a `CKAsset` from CloudKit, the URL will point to the remotely stored data.

You must initialize a `CKAsset` with a file path URL. Core Data does not give you a URL pointer to the photo data. You will need to create a variable `temporaryPhotoURL` that copies the `photoData: NSData?` to a temporary directory and returns the URL to that directory.

3. Add a `temporaryPhotoURL` lazy property that returns an `NSURL` reference to the data the `CKAsset` should upload. 
    * Lazy properties are only loaded when accessed, and are only loaded once. This differs from a computed property in that a computed property is calculated each time the property is accessed. You use a lazy property as the `temporaryPhotoURL` because it will perform disk operations that are computationally expensive. You do not want to perform a disk operation unless you _need_ the temporary photo URL, and if you need it, you do not want to perform the disk operation each time it is accessed.
4. Implement the lazy property by capturing the path of the temporary directory, initializing an NSURL with that path, initializing a file URL that uses the `self.recordName` property with jpg as the file extension. Write `self.photoData` to that file URL, and then return the file URL.

```swift
    lazy var temporaryPhotoURL: NSURL = {
        
        // Must write to temporary directory to be able to pass image file path url to CKAsset
        
        let temporaryDirectory = NSTemporaryDirectory()
        let temporaryDirectoryURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: temporaryDirectory)
        let fileURL = temporaryDirectoryURL.URLByAppendingPathComponent(self.recordName).URLByAppendingPathExtension("jpg")
        
        self.photoData?.writeToURL(fileURL, atomically: true)
        
        return fileURL
    }()
```

5. Add the convenience initializer `init?(record: CKRecord, context: NSManagedObjectContext)`.
6. Implement the convenience initializer by guarding for the timestamp and photo data, initializing the entity, and setting the `timestamp`, `photoData`, `recordIDData`, and `recordName` properties.
    * note: Use `NSKeyedArchiver` to archive the `recordIDData`.

#### Update Comment for Sync Functionality

Adopt the `CloudKitManagedObject` protocol in the `Comment` class.

1. Add a computed property `recordType` and return the type you would like used to identify 'Comment' objects in CloudKit.
2. Add a computed property `cloudKitRecord` that returns an optional `CKRecord?` representation of the `Comment`. Include the `timestamp`, `text`, and a `CKReference` to the `Comment`'s `Post`'s `CKRecord`.
    * note: Consider what you want to happen to a `Comment` if the `Post` is deleted in CloudKit when assigning the action.
    * note: You will need to guard for the `Comment`'s `Post` and the `Post`'s `cloudKitRecord` to be able to initialize the `CKReference`.
3. Add the convenience initializer `init?(record: CKRecord, context: NSManagedObjectContext)`.
4. Implement the convenience initializer by guarding for the timestamp and post reference, initializing the entity, and setting the `timestamp`, `text`, `recordIDData`, and `recordName` properties. 
    * note: Use `NSKeyedArchiver` to archive the `recordIDData`.

Remember that a `Comment` should not exist without a `Post`. You will also need to set the `Post` relationship in the convenience initializer. Consider how you would approach this. 

5. Add a function `postWithName` to the `PostController` that takes a name parameter as a `String` and returns a `Post?` object.
6. Implement the function to initialize and execute a `NSFetchRequest` for any `Post` object with a matching `recordName`. Return the first result, or nil if the fetch fails.
7. Use the new `postWithName` function in the required `CloudKitManagedObject` initializer to set `self.post` to the result of the `postWithName` using the unwrapped `CKReference`.

#### Update the Post Controller for Manual Sync

Update the `PostController` to support pushing and pulling data from CloudKit using the `CloudKitManager` class.

To implement sync, you will need to save a record to CloudKit when a new `Post` or `Comment` is created, fetch new records from CloudKit and serialize them into `Post` and `Comment` objects, write a `performFullSync` function that will push all unsynced objects to CloudKit and check for any new `Post` or `Comment` objects, and then update the user interface to support the new functionality.

1. Add a `cloudKitManager` property and set it to a new instance of the `CloudKitManager` class in the initializer.
2. Update the `createPost` function to unwrap the `post.cloudKitRecord`, and call the `cloudKitManager.saveRecord` function. Use the completion closure to call the `update(record: CKRecord)` on the `Post` to persist the `CKRecordID`.
3. Update the `addCommentToPost` function to unwrap the `comment.cloudKitRecord`, and call the `cloudKitManager.saveRecord` function. Use the completion closure to call the `update(record: CKRecord)` on the `Comment` to persist the `CKRecordID`.

At this point, each new `Post` or `Comment` should be pushed to CloudKit when new instances are created from the Add Post or Post Detail scenes.

##### Synced and Unsynced Records

As you implement the next few steps, you will want to be able to get a list of synced records and unsynced records. Create two helper functions that will help you do so.

1. Add a `syncedRecords` function that takes a `type` parameter as a `String` and returns an array of `CloudKitManagedObject`s.
2. Implement the function.
    * note: There are many ways you could approach this. Choose one and implement it independently.
3. Add a `unsyncedRecords` function that takes a `type` parameter as a `String` and returns an array of `CloudKitManagedObject`s.
4. Implement the function.
    * note: There are many ways you could approach this. Choose one and implement it independently.

You should now be able to fetch either synced or unsynced `Post` and `Comment` objects, which will help you determine which objects need to be saved, or which objects need to be excluded from any new fetches.

##### Fetch New Records

There are a number of approaches you could take to fetching new records. You could save a `lastSyncDate` and fetch any new records created since that date. You could also create a list of objects you already have stored locally, and send that to CloudKit and basically say 'Give me any record that isn't in this list.'

Not every backend service will support a request like the latter. CloudKit does. Doing it this way will avoid a lot of date logic, and will be a more comprehensive fetch with fewer points of failure.

1. Add a `fetchNewRecords` function that takes a `type` parameter as a `String`, and an optional completion closure.
    * note: You will use this function to fetch `Post` objects, then fetch `Comment` objects after the first call completes. You want to fetch `Comment`s _after_ `Post` objects because you want to make sure you have all `Post` objects before you initialize a `Comment` that may not have an accompanying `Post` downloaded yet.
2. Create an array of `CKReference` objects to exclude from the new query by calling the `syncedRecords` function and using `flatMap` to capture the `CKReference` objects.
    * note: The list of objects to exclude that you will send to CloudKit must be made up of CKReference objects. It will not work if you use `CKRecordID`s or `CKRecord`s.
3. Create a predicate that says that 'do not give me any CKRecords with recordIDs that match this list of references to exclude'.
    * note: `NSPredicate(format: "NOT(recordID IN %@)", argumentArray: [referencesToExclude])`
4. If the `referencesToExclude` is empty, you need to use a simple `true` `NSPredicate`. Otherwise the above predicate will not work.
5. Call the `cloudKitManager.fetchRecordsWithType` function. Use the `recordFetchedBlock` to switch the type, initialize the correct `Post` or `Comment` object, and save the context. Use the function's completion block to check for errors and run the optional completion block parameter.

##### Push Changes

Add functionality that will check for any unsynced records and attempt to save them to CloudKit. Theoretically, if you save each new `Post` and `Comment` to CloudKit as they are initialized, this function will not need to be used very often. But your users may have connectivity issues, or CloudKit may be down right when they create a `Post` or `Comment`, so you should build a backstop that will push them the next time the user opens the app or attemps a sync.

1. Add a `pushChangestoCloudKit` function that takes a completion parameter with a `success` `Bool` and an optional `NSError` parameters.
2. Create an single array of unsynced `Post` and `Comment` objects, flatMap to an array of `CKRecord` objects.
3. Call the `cloudKitManager.saveRecords` function. Use the `perRecordCompletion` to update the matching object with the `CKRecord` (filter the `unsavedManagedObjects` for the first object that matches the `record.recordID.recordName`) Use the `completion` to call the optional `completion` with a success flag.

##### Full Manual Sync

Add functionality that will perform a full sync by pushing all unsynced changes to CloudKit, then fetching and serializing any new records.

1. Add a `performFullSync` function that takes an optional completion closure.
2. Implement the function by calling `pushChangesToCloudKit`, when it completes, call the `fetchNewRecords` to fetch new `Post` objects, when that completes, call the `fetchNewRecords` to fetch new `Comment` objects, when that completes call the optional `completion` closure.
    * note: You want to nest these calls because you only want one to happen after the previous one has completely finished. If you call them asynchronously, you may get `Comment` objects that do not have an initialized `Post`, or other unexpected behavior.
3. Call the `performFullSync` function in the `PostController` initializer.

//TODO Add 'isSyncing' logic

#### Update the Post List Table View Controller

Update the Post List view to support Pull to Refresh to initiate a sync operation.

1. Add a new function to request a full sync operation that takes an optional completion closure. Implement the function by turning on the network activity indicator, calling the `performFullSync` function on the `PostController`, and turning off the network activity indicator in the completion.
2. Call the function in the `viewDidLoad` lifecycle function to initiate a full sync when the user first opens the application.
3. Add and implement a `UIRefreshControl` IBAction that uses the sync function.

Note the convenience of the `NSFetchedResultsController` handling the UI updates. You do not need to write any code that reloads the view or watches for when syncing finishes. 

#### Check Functionality

At this point the app should support basic push and fetch syncing from CloudKit. Use your Simulator and your Device to create new `Post` and `Comment` objects. Use the Refresh Control to initiate new sync operations between the two instances of your app. Check for and fix any bugs.

#### Fix Double Sync Bug

There is a bug in the app that may result in duplicate `Post` and `Comment` objects being initialized and stored into Core Data. Reproduce the bug using the following steps:

1. Open a fresh instance of the app.
2. While the Timeline scene is empty, use the refresh control to start a new sync operation.
3. Identify the problem and implement the solution.

## Part Four - Intermediate CloudKit: Subscriptions, Push Notifications, Automatic Sync

* use subscriptions to generate push notifications
* use push notifications to run a push based sync engine

Implement Subscriptions and push notifications to create a simple automatic sync engine. Add support for subscribing to new `Post` records and for subscribing to new `Comment` records on followed `Posts`s. Request permission for remote notifications. Respond to remote notifications by initializing the new `Post` or `Comment` with the new data.

When you finish this part, the app will support syncing photos, posts, and comments from remote notifications generated when new records are created in CloudKit. This will allow all devices that have given permission for remote notifications the ability to sync new posts and comments automatically. When new posts or comments are created in CloudKit, they will be serialized into Core Data objects, and the Fetched Results Controllers will automatically updat ethe user interface with the new data.


### Add Subscription Support to the CloudKitManager

Build functionality into your `CloudKitManager` that can be used to manage subscriptions and push notifications. Add support for adding a subscription, fetching a single subscription, fetching all subscriptions, and deleting a subscription.

1. Add the following properties and function signatures that perform basic CloudKit subscription management functionality. 

```swift

    // MARK: - Subscriptions
    
    func subscribe(type: String, predicate: NSPredicate, subscriptionID: String, contentAvailable: Bool, alertBody: String? = nil, desiredKeys: [String]? = nil, options: CKSubscriptionOptions, completion: ((subscription: CKSubscription?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?) 
    
    func unsubscribe(subscriptionID: String, completion: ((subscriptionID: String?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)
    
    func fetchSubscriptions(completion: ((subscriptions: [CKSubscription]?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)
    
    func fetchSubscription(subscriptionID: String, completion: ((subscription: CKSubscription?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?)
```

2. Using the documentation for CloudKit, fulfill the contract of each function signature. Using the data passed in as a paremeter, write code that will return the requested information. When it makes sense to do so using the NSOperation subclasses, try to use them over the convenience functions.

### PostController Subscription Based Sync

Update the `PostController` class to manage subscriptions for new posts and new comments on followed posts. Add functions for following and unfollowing individual posts.

When a user follows a `Post`, he or she will receive a push notification and automatic sync for new `Comment` records added to the followed `Post`.

#### Subscribe to New Posts

Create and save a subscription for all new `Post` records.

1. Add a function `subscribeToNewPosts` that takes an optional completion closure with `success` `Bool` and `error` `NSError?` parameters.
    * note: Use an identifier that describes that this subscription is for all posts.
2. Implement the function by using the `CloudKitManager` to subscribe to newly created `Post` records. Run the completion closure, passing a successful result if the subscription is successfully saved.
3. Call the `subscribeToNewPosts` in the initializer for the `PostController` so that each user is subscribed to new `Post` records saved to CloudKit.

#### Subscribe to New Comments

Create and save a subscription for all new `Comment` records that point to a given `Post`

1. Add a function `addSubscriptionToPostComments` that takes a `Post` parameter, an optional `alertBody` `String` parameter, and an optional completion closure with `success` `Bool` and `error` `NSError` parameters.
2. Implement the function by using the `CloudKitManager` to subscribe to newly created `Comment` records that point to the `post` parameter. Run the completion closure, passing a successful result if the subscription is successfully saved.
    * note: You will need to be able to identify this subscription later if you choose to delete it. Use a unique identifier on the `Post` as the identifier for the subscription so you can manage the matching subscription as needed.
    * note: You will need an NSPredicate that checks if the `Comment`'s `post` is equal to the `post` parameter's `CKRecordID`

#### Manage Post Comment Subscriptions

The Post Detail scene allows users to follow and unfollow new `Comment`s on a given `Post`. Add a function for removing a subscription, and another function that will toggle a subscription for a given `Post`.

1. Add a function `removeSubscriptionToPostcomments` that takes a `Post` parameter and an optional completion closure with `success` and `error` parameters.
2. Implement the function by using the `CloudKitManager` to unsubscribe to the subscription for that `Post`.
    * note: Use the unique identifier you used to save the subscription above. Most likely this will be your unique `recordName` for the `Post`.
3. Add a function `checkSubscriptionToPostComments` that takes a `Post` parameter and an optional completion closure with a `subscribed` `Bool` parameter.
4. Implement the function by using the `CloudKitManager` to fetch a subscription with the `post.recordName` as an identifier. If the subscription is not nil, the user is subscribed. If the subscription is nil, the user is not subscribed. Run the completion closure with the appropriate parameters.
5. Add a function `togglePostCommentSubscription` that takes a `Post` parameter and an optional completion closure with `success`, `isSubscribed`, and `error` parameters.
6. Implement the function by using the `CloudKitManager` to fetch subscriptions, check for a subscription that matches the `Post`, removes it if it exists, or adds it if it does not exist. Run the optional completion closure with the appropriate parameters.

### Update User Interface

Update the Post Detail scene's `Follow Post` button to display the correct text based on the current user's subscription. Update the outlet to toggle subscriptions for new comments on a `Post`.

1. Update the `updateWithPost` function to call the `checkSubscriptionToPostcomments` on the `PostController` and set appropriate text for the button based on the response.
2. Implement the `Follow Post` button's IBAction to call the `togglePostcommentSubscription` function on the `PostController` and update the `Follow Post` button's text based on the new subscription state.

### Add Permissions

Update the Info.plist to declare backgrounding support for responding to remote notifications. Request the user's permission to display remote notifications.

1. Open the `Info.plist` file and add the following code to declare backgrounding support to respond to remote notifications:

```
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>remote-notification</string>
    </array>
```

2. Request the user's permission to display notifications in the `AppDelegate` `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` function.
    * note: Use the `registerUserNotificationSettings` function.

### Handle Received Push Notifications

At this point the application will save subscriptions to the CloudKit database, and when new `Post` or `Comment` records are created that match those subscriptions, the CloudKit database will deliver a push notification to the application with the record data.

Handle the push notification by serializing the data into a `Post` or `Comment` object, and persisting the object to Core Data. If the user is actively using the application, the Fetched Results Controller will handle updating the Timeline or Post Detail views with the new data.

1. Add the `didReceiveRemoteNotification` delegate function to the `AppDelegate`.
2. Implement the function by guarding against the user info parameter as a [String: AnyObject], initializing a `CKQueryNotification` from the unwrapped user info dictionary, guarding against the record ID, and using the `CloudKitManager` instance on the `PostController` to fetch the matching `CKRecord`. Switch on the returned record's `recordType`. If it is a `Post`, initialize a `Post` from the `CKRecord`, if it is a `Comment`, initialize a `Comment` from the `CKRecord`, otherwise, return. Save the context after initializing the new object. Run the completion handler by passing the `UIBackgroundFetchResult.NewData` response.
